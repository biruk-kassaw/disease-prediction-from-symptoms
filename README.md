# Diseases Prediction from Symptoms

This project implements four algorithms - Decision Tree, Gradient Boost, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest - to predict diseases from given symptoms. It takes the result predicted by most algorithms to provide the final disease prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was found from the following link on Kaggle: "https://www.kaggle.com/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning". It contains symptoms and their corresponding diseases, which are used to train the algorithms.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `demo.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the notebook cells to start the demo.
4. Enter the symptoms in the input fields provided and click on "Predict" to get the predicted disease along with the confidence level.

## Usage

The program takes a CSV file as input, which contains the symptoms and their corresponding disease. The program then trains the algorithms using this data and makes predictions based on the input provided. The output displays the predicted disease along with the confidence level.

## Algorithms

The following algorithms are implemented in this project:

1. Decision Tree
2. Gradient Boost
3. Naive Bayes
4. Random Forest
